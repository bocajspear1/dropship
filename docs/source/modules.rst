Modules are the core of Dropship's functionality. Dropship modules contain Python code and Ansible scripts that work together to perform a configuration. However, modules in Dropship aren't exactly plug-and-play, and you'll need to adjust them slightly for your environment. This is mostly limited to usernames and image names.
